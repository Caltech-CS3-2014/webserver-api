# The dispatch mechanism does substring matching on the locations for the
# handlers, in the order they appear in the config file, and dispatches to the
# first one that matches.
#
# For example:
# * /static/foo matches /static/ and will dispatch to the first static
#   file handler
# * /foo will match "/" and will dispatch to the 404Handler.
#
# The general syntax of a handler stanza is:
#
# handler <handler class name> {
#   location <url prefix>;
#   <other configs>
# }
#
# The <other configs> will depend on the particular handler class, and will be
# interpreted by the handler's Initialize() method.
